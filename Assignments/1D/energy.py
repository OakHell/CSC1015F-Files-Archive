#Program to calculate energy based off given inputs.

m=int(input("Enter the value of m:\n")) #Takes in user input for m
c=int(input("Enter the value of c:\n"))**2 #Takes in user input for c, and squares it.
E=str(m*c) #Takes the product of m and c, and converts to a string.
print("The value of energy, E, is: "+E) #Output
